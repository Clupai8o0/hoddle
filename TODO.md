# TODO — Hoddle Melbourne

Phase 2 scope: **Mentor profiles + dashboard, Content library, Forums, Success stories, Live Q&A, Notifications, Matching algorithm v1.** All seven surfaces ship together as the full mentorship experience. See `CLAUDE.md` §5.

Format: `- [ ] task` for pending, `- [x] task` for done. Move completed items to `## Shipped` at the bottom and mirror in `docs/changelog.md`.

## 0. Phase 2 foundations

- [x] Install dependencies: `@tanstack/react-query` (interactive dashboards), `date-fns`, `@tiptap/react` + `@tiptap/starter-kit` (rich-text editor), `react-day-picker` (Q&A scheduling), `resend` (transactional email)
- [x] Add Resend API key to `.env.local.example` and Vercel envs
- [x] Set up `lib/email/` with typed email-sending wrapper around Resend
- [x] Add `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, `RESEND_API_KEY` env vars
- [x] Create new route segments: `app/(app)/mentors`, `app/(app)/content`, `app/(app)/forums`, `app/(app)/stories`, `app/(app)/sessions`, `app/(app)/inbox`, `app/(admin)`
- [x] Add `(admin)` route group with admin-only middleware check (`profiles.role = 'admin'`)
- [x] Update `MarketingShell` and `AuthenticatedShell` nav to expose new top-level destinations

## 5b. Photography — swap gradient placeholders with generated images

## 10. Matching algorithm v1

Goal: surface 3–5 mentor recommendations per student based on onboarding answers. Phase 2 uses a simple weighted-score approach, not ML.

- [ ] Define scoring rules in `lib/matching/score.ts`:
  - country_of_origin match → +30
  - field_of_interest overlap → +15 per overlap
  - challenges overlap with mentor expertise → +10 per overlap
  - goals overlap with mentor expertise → +10 per overlap
  - verified mentor → required (filter, not score)
- [ ] Server function `computeRecommendationsForProfile(profileId)` — runs the score, returns top 5 with reasoning strings
- [ ] Persist results in `mentor_recommendations` table; recompute on onboarding update or nightly via cron
- [ ] Recommendation card with "why this mentor" line ("Also from India, also studying engineering")
- [ ] Recommended mentors section on student dashboard (replaces Phase 1 placeholder)
- [ ] Fallback: if fewer than 3 matches score above threshold, fill with most-recently-active verified mentors
- [ ] Log click-throughs from recommendation → mentor profile for future ranking improvements (Phase 3)

## 11. Cross-cutting

- [ ] Update student dashboard to surface: recommended mentors, latest content, upcoming sessions you're registered for, recent forum activity in your interest areas
- [ ] Update `EmptyState` pattern usages — replace Phase 1 placeholders across the dashboard with real data
- [ ] Search: basic full-text search across content, mentors, and forums using Postgres `tsvector`
- [ ] Image uploads via Supabase Storage with client-side resize before upload
- [ ] Slug generation helper for content, mentors, threads, stories
- [ ] Pagination pattern for list pages (cursor-based on `created_at`)
- [ ] Rate limiting on user-generated content endpoints (forum posts, questions, story submissions) — Vercel KV or Supabase row-based
- [ ] Add `useFollow(mentorId)` hook + `mentor_follows` join table for "follow a mentor" interactions

## 12. Pre-ship checks

- [ ] `pnpm build` passes with no TS errors
- [ ] All Phase 2 routes work end-to-end as a student: dashboard → recommendations → mentor profile → content → register for session → ask question → receive notification
- [ ] All Phase 2 routes work end-to-end as a mentor: invite email → signup → onboarding → publish content → schedule session → answer questions
- [ ] All Phase 2 routes work end-to-end as an admin: invite mentor → verify → moderate stories
- [ ] RLS verified for every new table (cross-user isolation tests)
- [ ] Admin role enforcement verified (non-admin cannot reach `(admin)` routes)
- [ ] Notification emails render correctly in Gmail, Outlook web, and Apple Mail
- [ ] Matching algorithm produces sensible results for at least 5 seed student profiles
- [ ] Mobile responsive at 375px, 768px, 1280px across all new pages
- [ ] No hardcoded hex values, no `#ffffff`, no `#000000`, no decorative icons (grep checks)
- [ ] Update `docs/changelog.md` for Phase 2 release
- [ ] Tag release `v0.2.0` and update `docs/architecture.md` if any architectural decisions changed during the build
